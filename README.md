# NLP-Model
Industry NLP Project: Smart Customer Support Summarizer + Auto-Responder (with RAG, NER, Sentiment, and LoRA)
Problem
Companies deal with huge volumes of customer queries. Manually reading, summarizing, and answering is slow, expensive, and error-prone.
 Solution
Build an LLM-powered pipeline that:

Summarizes customer conversations

Detects sentiment and frustration

Extracts key entities (user names, products)

Uses RAG to suggest auto-replies from documentation

Efficiently fine-tuned using LoRA
